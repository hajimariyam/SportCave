## Overview
### Description
An Android mobile appâ€”browse sports, view scoring updates for domestic and international games, and connect with fellow sports fans by sharing reactions.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Sports / Social
- **Mobile:** Check for scoring updates and post reactions on-the-go, use camera/gallery to post photos to reactions feed and update profile photo.
- **Story:** SportCave allows users to receive updates for different sports in one location rather than scouring different platforms for each sport.
- **Market:** Any sports fan would enjoy this app. Present sports scores apps do not allow for individual user accounts and social interaction; on SportCave,  users can connect with fellow fans by sharing reactions.
- **Habit:**  Users can check back as often as they'd like, multiple times a day.
- **Scope:** Initial features are to view scoring updates and share reactions with other fans. App can be expanded to include livestreaming links and map and calendar functionalities.
